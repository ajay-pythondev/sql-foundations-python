# SQL Foundations for Data Engineering with Python

Welcome! This repository is for anyone who wants to build a solid foundation in **SQL** and **Python** to move toward a career in **data engineering**.

Youâ€™ll learn how to write SQL from scratch, interact with databases using Python, and build real-world data workflows step-by-step â€” even if you're starting with just basic Python knowledge.

---

## âœ… What You'll Learn

By the end of this series, you will be able to:

1. Understand SQL and how relational databases work
2. Perform CRUD operations using SQLite and Python
3. Write queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, etc.
4. Connect Python with databases using `sqlite3/PostgreSQL` and `pandas`
5. Build basic ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load)
6. Model your data using best practices (normalization, relationships)
7. Schedule tasks using tools like `cron` or **Apache Airflow**
8. Prepare for real-world data engineering roles with hands-on code

## ðŸ”— Technologies Used

- **SQL** â€“ Structured Query Language
- **SQLite** â€“ Lightweight file-based database
- **Python 3** â€“ With `sqlite3`, `PostgreSQL`, `pandas`
- **IDE (Pycharm/VS Code)** â€“ For interactive development
- **Airflow**, **PostgreSQL**, **Pandas** â€“ For later stages
